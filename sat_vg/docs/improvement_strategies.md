# SatVG Improvement Strategies

This document outlines potential strategies for improving the SatVG model's performance on satellite visual grounding tasks. Each set of strategies is dated to track when ideas were proposed.

## April 17, 2025: ViT-based Enhancement Strategies

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Enhanced ViT Integration**
   - Use patch size variation (8×8 instead of 16×16) for finer-grained feature extraction
   - Implement a hierarchical ViT to capture features at multiple scales
   - Add cross-attention layers between text and each level of visual features

2. **Feature Pyramid Integration**
   - Add FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) to the output of ViT for multi-scale feature representation
   - Incorporate DETR-style decoder with learned query embeddings

3. **Position-Aware Mechanisms**
   - Add relative position encoding for better spatial understanding
   - Implement deformable attention to focus on relevant image regions

### Training Strategies

1. **Progressive Training**
   - First pre-train on image-level classification
   - Then train on region proposal
   - Finally fine-tune on precise localization

2. **Curriculum Learning**
   - Start with easy examples (high contrast objects)
   - Gradually introduce more difficult examples

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - More aggressive augmentation: rotation, scale variation, color jittering
   - Mixup and CutMix adapted for grounding tasks
   - Synthetic data generation with varied object positions

### Hyperparameter Optimization

1. **Learning Rate Schedule**
   - Try a cyclical learning rate instead of standard decay
   - Implement layer-wise learning rates (higher for ViT layers, lower for BERT)

2. **Optimization Improvements**
   - Test SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) optimizer
   - Increase weight decay for better generalization
   - Gradient centralization for stable training

### Loss Function Enhancements

1. **Multi-component Loss**
   - Combine regression loss with auxiliary classification loss
   - Add IoU loss or GIoU loss alongside L1/L2 loss
   - Implement uncertainty-weighted losses for different components

2. **Self-supervised Auxiliary Tasks**
   - Add masked patch prediction task
   - Incorporate contrastive learning between text and image patches

### Model Inspection and Debug

1. **Attention Visualization**
   - Analyze where the model's attention is focused
   - Identify failure patterns (small objects, ambiguous descriptions)

2. **Gradual Unfreezing**
   - Start with frozen backbone, then gradually unfreeze layers
   - Monitor gradient magnitude across different components

### Ensemble Methods

1. **Multi-backbone Ensemble**
   - Combine predictions from models with different backbones (ViT, ResNet, ConvNeXt)
   - Train specialized models for different object types/sizes

2. **Test-time Augmentation**
   - Average predictions from multiple augmented versions of test images

## Priority Recommendations

Based on immediate potential gains, these strategies are highest priority:

1. **IoU-based Loss Function** - Directly optimizes the evaluation metric
2. **Enhanced Position Encoding** - Critical for spatial understanding in satellite imagery
3. **Feature Pyramid Integration** - Helps with objects at different scales
4. **Deformable Attention** - Allows the model to focus on relevant regions

## Implementation Plan

1. First experiment with loss function changes (quickest to implement with potentially large gains)
2. Then enhance position encoding and implement feature pyramid
3. Finally explore more complex architectural changes (deformable attention, hierarchical ViT)
