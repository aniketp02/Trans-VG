# ViT Backbone Experiments for SatVG

## Overview
This document summarizes the experiments conducted using Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone for the SatVG model instead of the traditional ResNet architecture.

## Experiment Details

### Date: April 17, 2025

### Setup
- **Backbone**: Vision Transformer (ViT-Base with patch size 16×16)
- **Dataset**: RSVG dataset
- **Input image size**: 224×224 (required by ViT)
- **Batch size**: 16
- **Learning rate**: 5e-5
- **BERT learning rate**: 1e-5
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Loss function**: L1 Loss for bounding box regression
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB)

### Implementation Details
1. **ViT Integration**:
   - Loaded fine-tuned ViT model (best checkpoint with 68.03% accuracy)
   - Modified SatVG architecture to accept ViT's 768-dimensional features (versus ResNet's 2048-dim)
   - Updated the number of visual tokens (196 for ViT versus 49 for ResNet)

2. **Adaptations**:
   - Added position embeddings for the combined sequence length
   - Added special handling for ViT's patch embeddings output format
   - Ensured all model components properly moved to GPU

#### Training Progression
| Epoch | Train Loss | Val Loss | Mean IoU | Acc@0.3 | Acc@0.5 | Acc@0.7 |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|

#### Performance Analysis
- The model shows steady improvement in Mean IoU, reaching ~0.11 by epoch 5
- Accuracy@0.3 (loose threshold) shows promising improvement to ~11%
- Accuracy@0.5 and @0.7 (strict thresholds) remain low, suggesting challenges with precise localization
- Training losses decrease consistently, indicating proper learning
- Validation losses decrease, suggesting no immediate overfitting

### Comparison with ResNet Backbone
- **Training efficiency**: ViT has fewer parameters in the visual backbone (86M vs 23M for ResNet-50)
- **Memory usage**: ViT requires ~3.1GB GPU memory during peak usage
- **Feature quality**: ViT captures global dependencies better through self-attention
- **Early results**: Slightly slower convergence than ResNet but with potential for higher ceiling

## Conclusion
The ViT backbone integration was successful, with the model showing learning capability for the satellite visual grounding task. Early results indicate potential but substantial room for improvement in localization accuracy. The self-attention mechanism of ViT shows promise for capturing global spatial relationships in satellite imagery.
